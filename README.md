# Minimalist Timer 
Tired of wasting time not being productive? Tired of seeing time pass by you without getting your work done! If so, use this timer to keep track of how much time has passed since you sat down at a cafe or library. 
That way you will be able to be as productive as possible. 

The timer has a minimalist look similar to the one of a terminal allowing it to be distraction free.
In conclusion, it is simple, there is a timer and it ticks!
