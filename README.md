# Timer
Minimalist Timer 
Tired of wasting time not being productive? If so, use this timer to keep track of how much time has passed since you sat down at a cafe or library. 
That way you will be able to be as productive as possible. 

The timer has a minimalist look similar to the one of a terminal allowing it to be distraction free.
In conclusion, it is simple, there is a timer and it ticks!
